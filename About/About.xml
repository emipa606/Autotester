I made this to ease my testing of mods before publishing. A few people asked about it so I decided to publish it. 
If you are not a modder this is probably not of any use to you and for most modders the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2922590693]Spawn Mod Content[/url]-mod should be enough for testing.
However if you have a lot of mods, it might help with automatic testing of these mods.

[h3]How to use[/h3]
[list]
[*]Populate the mod-list outside of the game, with the mod you want to test at the last place in the mod-list
[*]Start RimWorld with the -quicktest parameter causing it to go directly to a default test map
[*]With this mod loaded the test-map will be smaller (100x100) to increase map-load speed
[*]The mod will open and close any mod-config of the test-mod
[*]It will will use the Spawn Mod Content-mod to spawn everything
[*]It will then in turn select each item spawned
[*]When there are no more items it will close the game
[/list]

If there are any warnings or errors it will close the game instantly.
All warnings and errors will have a [Warning] or [Error] prefix in the log to find them easy.
It will also create a TranslationTemplate folder in the Source-folder of the mod.
This will contain English translation-data for all Defs as a template for other languages.
